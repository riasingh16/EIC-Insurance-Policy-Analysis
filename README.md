## EIC-Insurance-Policy-Analysis

### Project Overview:

EIC was among the leading motor insurance providers between 2014 and 2018. Despite their prominence, the company experienced persistent underwriting losses, ultimately ceasing operations in early 2019. This analysis explores the underlying financial challenges and key patterns that contributed to the company's downfall.

 **Project Goals:**

 1. Identify the root causes of consistent insurance losses.
 2. Evaluate product profitability by vehicle and usage type.
 3. Assess the effectiveness of risk assessment and pricing strategies.
 4. Provide data-driven insights to visualize trends, and support stakeholder understanding.

    
 ### Data Summary:

 Rows analyzed: 508K
 
 Timeframe: 2014 – 2018

 ### Data Structure Overview:



 ### Executive Summary: 

EIC’s financial deterioration was primarily driven by a mismatch between premium pricing and claim liabilities, particularly among high-risk vehicle usages like General     Cartage. Despite strong sales, inadequate underwriting discipline and flawed risk pricing led to compounding losses. A more data-driven, segmented pricing strategy and tighter  claims control—especially around commercial usage—could have mitigated the fallout.

 ### Insights:

 **1. Sustained Underwriting Losses Across 15 Quarters**

    
- The premium-to-claim ratio consistently remained below 100%, indicating that EIC paid out more in claims than it collected in premiums.

- This imbalance persisted across 15 consecutive quarters—a span of four years—highlighting a structurally unprofitable business model.

- Losses continued until the final quarter of 2018, after which EIC exited the market.

**2. Unprofitable Claim Economics**

   
- The average claim payout was $18,000, while the average premium collected was just $8,000.

- Despite low claim frequency (only ~10% of policyholders filed claims), those few claims were high in value, severely impacting profitability.

- This suggests that the company didn’t price its policies well, and a small number of claimants ended up costing it a lot of money.

**3. Vehicle Type Profitability Analysis**

   
- Only Motorcycles and Tractors generated consistent profits throughout the observed period.

- All other vehicle types, especially those used commercially, contributed to ongoing losses.


**4. High-Risk Usage Category: General Cartage**

   
- General Cartage accounted for the highest claim volumes and payouts.

- This segment was a major contributor to the company’s financial bleeding and may have been underpriced or underwritten without proper risk profiling.
